# Trading Standard

**Domain**: Rule-Based Probability Trading  
**Methodology**: Top-Down Multi-Timeframe Confluence

---

## 1. Core Trading Philosophy
*   **Rule-Based Execution**: Trading is rule-based, not emotional.
*   **Conformance Over Prediction**: Market prediction is not the goal. Only rule-conforming setups are allowed.
*   **Quality First**: No trade is better than a low-quality trade.

---

## 2. Probability-Based Evaluation Model

Each trade setup is scored based on predefined technical parameters.

### 2.1 Scoring Logic
*   Each parameter contributes a weighted score.
*   **Final Probability** = (Achieved Score / Total Possible Score) × 100.
*   Only aligned setups qualify for execution.

## 3. Grade Classification

| Grade | Probability | Strategy | Position Size |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| **A** | ≥ 85% | **Aggressive** | Full Size |
| **B** | ≥ 55% | **Conservative** | Half Size |
| **C** | < 55% | **Avoid** | No Trade |

## 4. Mandatory Top-Down Multi-Timeframe Rule

All trades must follow 3-layer alignment. If any of the three layers is misaligned or unclear, the trade is **rejected**.

### 4.1 Layer 1 – Trend Direction (Higher Timeframe)
*   Identify overall market direction.
*   Trade only in the direction of dominant trend.
*   Counter-trend setups are strictly rejected.

### 4.2 Layer 2 – Entry Zone (Medium Timeframe)
*   Entry must originate from a key support/resistance zone.
*   Valid pullback or structure retest required.
*   Random breakout chasing is not allowed.

### 4.3 Layer 3 – Entry Confirmation (Lower Timeframe)
*   Confirm entry with:
    *   Strong candlestick pattern (e.g., engulfing, pin bar).
    *   Volume confirmation.
    *   Breakout-retest structure.
*   **No confirmation = no entry.**

*   Top-Down Alignment
*   Trend Strength

## 6. Hard Rejection Conditions

*   **Risk-Reward < 1:2**
*   Higher timeframe trend is unclear or sideways.
*   Entry is not from a valid structure/zone.
*   Major high-impact news is imminent.

---

## 7. Execution Discipline
